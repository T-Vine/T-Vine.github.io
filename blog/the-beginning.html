            <p class="info">Hello! This is my first ever blog post here, so I thought I'd go over what I plan to do, and what you'll be able to find here.
                For information about me, check out the about page! Most of the things you'll see here will probably be coding, anything from website design to scientific Python or Rust.
                Most of my projects are without a particular aim in mind, rather to learn new skills: hence why I often mix them with biological or mathematical applications.
                Despite this, my future aims lie with anything that can help people or other animals, so really this documents my journey towards that. <br>
                <br>
                Though I'm not really a web-developer, I feel strongly about accessibility and such, which is why most of this website is hopefully so.
                <br>
                Some things you'll be seeing soon will be a post documenting my pure Python Maths library, and from there my journey into RSA encryption. 
                Hopefully then I'll explore the applications of AI in health and conversation in a more news-style post. Thanks for dropping by, hopefully see you later!
            </p>
