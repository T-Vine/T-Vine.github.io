			<p class="info">Hello there! 
				 <br>
				I'm T-Vine, an amateur programmer with a great love also for mathematics and biology. This site is currently under construction, but you can check out my Medium (via the Blog link in the Menu) to see some recent projects I've been up to.
				Personally, I love anything that pushes the boundaries of science, and especially those that are designed to help people and the world we live in. Currently my projects are small-scale to investigate different topics, though I am hopeful to contribute to something more in the future.
