			<h2 class="title">About Me</h2>
			<p class="info">Hello there! If you're new here, welcome! 
				If not, welcome back! I go by the name Moss, or otherwise T-Vine for my Github. <br>
				I'm a passionate biologist, mathematician, and overall a programmer, and I generally mix them all together. <br>
				My overarching goals in life are to discover new things, and help others with those things to the best of my ability.
				Apart from that, I'm a nature-lover and bread-baker: that's me summed up! Feel free to check out my other pages, 
				such as Projects for what I'm currently working on, Portfolio for my favourite past projects, 
				or Blog for a run-down of my most recent projects or experiments. </p>
